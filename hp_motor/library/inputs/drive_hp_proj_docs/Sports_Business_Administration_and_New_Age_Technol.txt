BAŞLIK: Sports Business Administration and New Age Technology: Role of AI
ÖZET: This chapter explores the complexities of sports governance, taxation, dispute resolution, and the impact of digital transformation within the sports sector. This study identifies a critical research gap regarding the integration of innovative technologies to enhance governance and talent identification in sports law. The objective is to evaluate how data-driven approaches and AI can optimize recruitment processes; also ensuring compliance with existing regulations. A comprehensive analysis of current governance structures and taxation policies,(ie Income Tax Act and GST Act), reveals preliminary results indicating that reform is necessary to support sustainable growth in the sports economy. Key findings demonstrate that AI enhances player evaluation by minimizing biases and expanding access to diverse talent pools. While the Court of Arbitration for Sport provides an efficient mechanism for dispute resolution. The implications emphasize the need for regulatory reforms that align taxation policies with international best practices, promoting transparency and accountability in sports organizations. This research contributes valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of sports management, aiming to foster innovation and integrity in the industry.
